All objects available in Grid Adventure V1 are shown below. Each entity is displayed in five slightly different visuals. Many other appearances exist that are similar but may differ subtly from those shown.

## Floor

![Floor](../assets/floors.png)

Floor is the basic tile of the grid. Other entities can also be present with floor tiles.


## Agent

![Agent](../assets/humans.png)

Agent is the character that you will control and play as. It appears in the grid as a human. You will move around the grid, interact with objects and aim to complete the objective.

In 1 turn, the Agent can either move to an adjacent tile (up/down/left/right), pickup a item, use a key to unlock a door or simply do nothing (wait).
The agent starts with some health points (up to 5) and the player loses if the HP drops to 0.

## Wall

![Wall](../assets/walls.png)

Walls can be present on the grid and blocks the agent from moving past them.

## Exit

![Exit](../assets/exits.png)
 
This is the final escape tile that the agent must reach to complete the objective.

## Coin

![Coin](../assets/coins.png)

Coin is a optional item that can be picked up on the grid. The agent may collect a coin to receive a reward of 5.


## Gem

![Gem](../assets/gems.png)

Gem is an item on the grid that needs to be picked up. If any gems are present, the agent must collect all of them before moving to the exit tile to complete the objective.

## Key

![Key](../assets/keys.png)

Key is an optional item on the grid that can be picked up by the agent. A key is required to unlock a door. Any key can be used to unlock a door, but each key can only be used once.

## Door

![Locked_Door](../assets/locked_doors.png)

A locked door blocks the agent from moving past it. To unlock a door, the agent must first collect a key. Using the key while standing adjacent to the door unlocks it, turning it into an unlocked door. The agent can then pass freely through unlocked doors. Unlocked doors appear on the grid as shown below.

## Box

![Box](../assets/boxes.png)

Box is an item on the grid that can be moved by the agent. The agent can push a box in any direction onto a free tile. Boxes cannot be pushed onto walls, doors, or lava.

## Lava

![Lava](../assets/lavas.png)

Lava tiles inflict damage to the agent. When the agent lands on lava, it takes 2 damage. The player loses if the agent's HP drops to 0.

## Powerups

Powerups may also appear on the grid and can be picked up by the agent. They provide temporary boosts and are associated with either a [turn limit](#turn-limit-anchor) or [usage limit](#usage-limit-anchor). The agent can pickup and have multiple powerups at once, including duplicates.

<a name="turn-limit-anchor"></a>
!!! info "Turn limit"
    Powerups with a turn limit count down after every turn. The effect expires when the limit reaches 0. If the agent picks up a duplicate powerup, both will count down simultaneously. Essentially, the turn limit is reset when the second powerup is picked up.

<a name="usage-limit-anchor"></a>
!!! info "Usage limit"
    Powerups with a usage limit count down only when used. It expires when the usage limit reaches 0. If the agent picks up a duplicate powerup, they will count down one after the other. The first powerup must be fully used up before the second one begins to be used.


### Speed Powerup

![Speed](../assets/boots.png)

The speed powerup allows the agent to move 2 tiles in 1 turn. It has a [turn limit](#turn-limit-anchor) of 5. Note that the agent can still be blocked by any objects in its path.

!!! note "Stacking"
    Even if the agent has 2 active speed powerups, it is still only able to move 2 tiles in 1 turn.

### Shield Powerup

![Shield](../assets/shields.png)

Shield protects the agent from damage taken. It has a [usage limit](#usage-limit-anchor) of 5. The shield is used once every time the agent lands on lava.

### Phasing Powerup

![Phasing](../assets/ghosts.png)

Phasing allows the agent to move through objects. It has a [turn limit](#turn-limit-anchor) of 5. While the powerup is active, the agent can move through walls, doors and boxes. The agent does not take damage from lava as well.
