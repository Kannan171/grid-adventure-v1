Welcome to Grid-Adventure-V1.

Grid Universe is a flexible, grid‑based environment in which you implement an agent that interacts with diverse gameplay mechanics to fulfil objectives.

The world is represented as a 2D grid made up of tiles. The Agent can start at any location in the grid and needs to work towards collecting gems if any, and to move to the escape tile.

This Player Guide is designed to help you understand every part of the game:

* **Entities** — the objects that you will encounter in the grid
* **Objectives** — what you must accomplish to complete a level
* **Movements** — how the Agent moves and interacts

Dive into each section to master the game and start gridding!
