# Game Representation

Grid Adventure: Variant 1 operates as a turn based game. Players are supplied a snapshot of a turn of the Game. Players then return an action, which is then used to generate the snapshot.

## Types of representation
There are 3 ways for a Game Snapshot to be represented.

| Representation Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| GridState Representation | A 2 dimensional Array of cells, accompanied with additional info stored in attributes |
| Observation Representation | An RGBA Image Array, accompanied  additional info stored in an Information Dictionary |
| State Representation | An Immutable world state. Stores information in various attributes, tracked by EntityID of each Entity |


&nbsp;
# GridState Representation
The Level Representation is a grid centric representation, that is easiest for players to follow

## GridState Attributes
The GridState class has 3 categories of attributes

- GridState Configuration
- Grid Structure
- Game Status

### GridState Configuration

| Attribute | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `width` | `int` | Grid width in tiles |
| `height` | `int` | Grid height in tiles |
| `movement` | `BaseMovement` | Movement function configuration |
| `objective` | `BaseObjective` | Win/lose condition configuration |
| `seed` | `int` or `None` | RNG seed for deterministic behavior |

### Grid Structure

| Attribute | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `grid` | `list[list[list[BaseEntity]]]` | Grid representation where `grid[x][y]` is a list of entities at that cell |

### Game Status

| Attribute | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `turn` | `int` | `0` | Current turn number |
| `score` | `int` | `0` | Cumulative score |
| `win` | `bool` | `False` | True if objective met |
| `lose` | `bool` | `False` | True if losing condition met |
| `message` | `str` or `None` | `None` | Optional status message for display |
| `turn_limit` | `int` or `None` | `None` | Max turns allowed |

&nbsp;
## Available Methods

| Method | Returns | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `gridstate.add(pos, obj)` | `None` | Place entity at position `(x, y)` |
| `gridstate.add_many(items)` | `None` | Place multiple entities from list of `(pos, obj)` tuples |
| `gridstate.remove(pos, obj)` | `bool` | Remove specific entity by identity; returns `True` if found |
| `gridstate.remove_if(pos, predicate)` | `int` | Remove entities where `predicate(obj)` is `True`; returns count |
| `gridstate.move_obj(from_pos, obj, to_pos)` | `bool` | Move entity between cells; returns `True` if successful |
| `gridstate.clear_cell(pos)` | `int` | Remove all entities from cell; returns count |
| `gridstate.objects_at(pos)` | `list[BaseEntity]` | Return shallow copy of entities at position |
| `to_state(gridstate)` | `None` | Converts mutable `GridState` to immutable `State` |
| `step(Gridstate, Action)` | `GridState` | Returns a new `GridState` object that is generated by the given Action |

Note: `pos` is of class `Position`, a (int, int)  
Note: `obj` is of class `BaseEntity`, parent class of all Entities. For more details about entities, Please refer to [Entity Classes](entities.md#entities).

# Observation Representation
The observation representation is created by the grid adventure game engine, and is non reversible. Players are not able to convert observation representation into GridState or State representation.

## Observation Attribute Hierachy
The observation Class represents the Game snapshot as a dictionary with the following hierachy.

```

## Image Usage Example
```python
from grid_adventure.env import GridAdventureEnv
from grid_universe.examples.maze import generate

env = GridAdventureEnv(
    initial_state_fn=generate, 
    width=9, 
    height=9
)
obs, info = env.reset()

image = obs["image"]  # shape: (H, W, 4), dtype: uint8

# Get image dimensions
height, width, channels = image.shape

# Save as PNG
from PIL import Image
pil_image = Image.fromarray(image)
pil_image.save("screenshot.png")

# Convert RGBA to RGB (remove alpha channel)
rgb_image = image[:, :, :3]

# Convert to grayscale
gray_image = np.mean(image[:, :, :3], axis=2).astype(np.uint8)

# Normalize for neural network input (0-1 range)
normalized = image.astype(np.float32) / 255.0

# Resize image
resized = Image.fromarray(image).resize((84, 84))
resized_array = np.array(resized)

# Display with matplotlib
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.imshow(image)
plt.axis("off")
plt.show()

# Stack frames for temporal context (e.g., last 4 frames)
frame_stack = np.stack([obs1["image"], obs2["image"], obs3["image"], obs4["image"]], axis=0)
```


&nbsp;
## InfoDict Usage Example

```python
from grid_universe.gym_env import GridUniverseEnv
from grid_universe.examples.maze import generate

env = GridUniverseEnv(
    initial_state_fn=generate, 
    width=9, 
    height=9
)
obs, info = env.reset()

# Access the rendered image
image = obs["image"]  # shape: (H, W, 4), dtype: uint8

# Access agent health
health = obs["info"]["agent"]["health"]["health"]
max_hp = obs["info"]["agent"]["health"]["max_health"]

# Check game phase
phase = obs["info"]["status"]["phase"]  # "ongoing", "win", or "lose"

# Get active effects
for effect in obs["info"]["agent"]["effects"]:
    print(f"Effect {effect['type']}: {effect['limit_amount']} remaining")

# Check inventory
for item in obs["info"]["agent"]["inventory"]:
    print(f"Item: {item['type']} (id={item['id']})")
```

# State Representation
The state representation is the internal representation used by the Grid Adventure game. It is lower level than the other representations, and the used to generate the GridState and Observation representations.

NOTE: You do not require the use of the State representation to be able to complete the capstone project. You can feel free to use this representation if you require it, but it is more complicated to learn and use than the GridState representation.

## State Attributes
The State Class represents the game snapshot with the following 4 types of attributes.

- Level Configuration
- Effect Configuration
- Property Componenets
- Game Status

### Level Configuration

## Usage Example
All effects and components are represented by Entities in the Grid Adventure game engine. Each entity is assigned a unique EntityID at creation. This EntityID is used to map to each attribute of the Entity. For more details about entities, Please refer to [Entity Classes](entities.md#entities).

---                                                                                                                                                                               
Example 1: Player Entity
                                                                
A player entity with EntityID = 1 that has position, health, appearance, and agent components:  
    
&emsp;&emsp;state.position[1]   = Position(x=3, y=5)  
&emsp;&emsp;state.health[1]     = Health(health=100, max_health=100)  
&emsp;&emsp;state.appearance[1] = Appearance(name="human", priority=10)  
&emsp;&emsp;state.agent[1]      = Agent()  
&emsp;&emsp;state.inventory[1]  = Inventory(item_ids=pset([2, 3]))  # holds items 2 and 3   

The same EntityID appears in multiple component stores, each holding a different aspect of that entity.

---
Example 2: Status Effect Entity

An immunity effect with EntityID = 50 applied to the player (EntityID = 1):

&emsp;&emsp;state.immunity[50]   = Immunity()  
&emsp;&emsp;state.time_limit[50] = TimeLimit(amount=10)  # lasts 10 turns  
&emsp;&emsp;state.status[1]      = Status(effect_ids=pset([50]))  # player has effect 50  

The effect itself is an entity (EntityID = 50) stored in immunity and time_limit. The player's status component references this effect by its ID.
